# Section 1: Project Title
## Smart Waste Management: Route Optimization and Predictive Maintenance

# Section 2: Executive Summary
Waste collection is a significant cost component for waste management companies, often making up 70-85% of solid waste management costs. Consequently, route optimisation can meaningfully reduce costs and improve earnings of waste management companies. In addition, route optimization would result in reduced carbon emissions, consistent with Singapore’s ambitions in combating climate change. Predictive maintenance scheduling is highly relevant to the market as it reduces breakdown frequency and improves service quality provided by waste management companies.
